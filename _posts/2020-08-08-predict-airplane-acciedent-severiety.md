This problem consists of building a machine learning model that could predict the severity of the airplance accident. The dataset consists of following features

 - Accident_ID
 - Accident_Type_Code
 - Cabin_Temperature
 - Turbulence_In_gforces
- Control_Metric
- Total_Safety_Complaints
- Days_Since_Inspection
- Safety_Score
- Violations
- Severity

Here, while building the model I have made use of the sklearn library and python programming language. I have tried following approaches:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Bagging Classifier
- XGBoost

The files contains the approaches that Iâ€™ve taken to solve the problem, which includes the data preprocessing, bulding the model. There were other techniques like feature elimination, feature correlation used, but are not mentioned in the files available.
